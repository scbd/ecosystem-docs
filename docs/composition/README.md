# Composition

## Concept
Since everything is a component Ecosystem abstract products by breaking them into 4 parts.

  1. `Particles`, that compose;
  2. `Elements`, that compose;
  3. `Molecules`, that compose;
  4. `Organisms`, (the highest level of component abstraction)


`Particles`: Are essentially design token describing the lowest level of color, spacing, font, z-index, padding and margins.

`Elements`: Mirror html elements such as buttons, paragraph and division.

`Molecules`:  Are more complex components consisting of other elements and molecules.

`Organisms`: The highest level of component abstraction usually representing a component that could be it's own application.
