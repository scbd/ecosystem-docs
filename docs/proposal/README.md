# The Proposal

## The Problems

### Standards Not Followed
Standards are not being followed by colleagues for a number of reasons.  Some identified reasons are:
- not knowing they exist
- disagreeing or inability to implement with no way to address and resolve grievances/issues
- human error
- momentary memory lapses

### Pixel Twiddling
 Engineers hate pixel-twiddling, spending weeks/months on design variations for products with little to no users.

### Slow Product Delivery
Spending time on style and design is very time consuming, new products should be focused on innovation and the problems being solved as apposed to appearance.

### Fuzzy mocks ups and/or Lack of Specifications
Engineers hate to make guesses about fuzzy mocks and specs.  Management hates shipping broken features that no one feels good about.

### Inconsistency
Engineers hate reinventing the wheel. Communications hate inconsistencies.

### Product Maintenance
Engineers hate maintaining X number of implementations of the same code.

### Inefficient Processes
Inefficient processes that lead to repetitive or wasted work.  Some Examples:
- Designers recreating all components that all past products have.
- Engineers maintaining and creating different versions of the same components.
- Programmes continually spending significant resources on pixel-twiddling and word-twiddling.

## Design System
Is an evolving ruleset governing the composition of products.  An organizations reusable, component-based approach to product development, product design and content creation.

Modern design systems consist of implementation standards, documentation, and principles along with the toolkit (UI patterns and code components) to achieve those standards.  Standards governing branding, all communication content, style, illustrations, video, code components and final products.

Ultimately, facilitating and improving communication among all audiences.

## Main Value
### Faster time to market with less money wasted
 A component-based toolkit accessible in one place allows for a more Agile process, speeding up releases without compromising quality.

### Increased product value
Reusable components build upon each other, which creates a more consistent look, feel, and behavior to the product. As consistency increases, so too does user efficiency.

### Increased collaboration and knowledge sharing
 Because the shared design system includes approved assets and conventions, designers, developers, content creators and management are more autonomous without closing off into silos.

## Innovation
Our design system with the proposed name 'Ecosystem' should aim to solve and do the above while programmatically enforcing standards upon completion.  Currently enforcing communication or branding standards has proven impossible at the SCBD.  Building a system that programmatically prevents us from violating the established standards is perhaps the only solution and based on my research is not done by any organization's design system.

Ecosystem will also serve other products programmatically with its reusable components not just it's human audiences of engineer, designers, content creators, communicators and management.

Ecosystem will be a living, breathing system that’s flexible, maintainable, stable, scalable, and successful in the long-term that allowing us put resources towards innovation to achieve Biodiversity Goals.

- Programmatically serve all future products's components
- Editable guide documentation targeted towards audiences of design, engineers, content creators and management
- Multi-lingual
- Partially self documenting tokens, styles and components
- ontology management
- Standards/Ruleset/Guides for :
  - internal communication
    - efficient design system change process
    - Ontology
    - audiences
  - external communication
    - branding
    - style
    - tone and voice
    - grammar and mechanics
    - component creation
